    <TPM:Description>
      Cairo is a 2D graphics library with support for multiple output
      devices. Currently supported output targets include the X Window
      System (via both Xlib and XCB), Quartz, Win32, image buffers,
      PostScript, PDF, and SVG file output. Experimental backends
      include OpenGL, BeOS, OS/2, and DirectFB.
      
      Cairo is designed to produce consistent output on all output
      media while taking advantage of display hardware acceleration
      when available (eg. through the X Render Extension).
      
      The cairo API provides operations similar to the drawing
      operators of PostScript and PDF. Operations in cairo including
      stroking and filling cubic BÃ©zier splines, transforming and
      compositing translucent images, and antialiased text
      rendering. All drawing operations can be transformed by any
      affine transformation (scale, rotation, shear, etc.)
      
      Cairo is implemented as a library written in the C programming
      language, but bindings are available for several different
      programming languages.
